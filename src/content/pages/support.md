* ✍🏼 **B.F. Griffith** is the primary author＆webmaster behind the [**λόγος** project](https://pansophos.github.io/LOGOS/about/), as well as its much broader overarching parent: the [**πάνσοφος** project](https://pansophos.github.io/about/), both of which you can most directly support through…

* If you find his work on these (or other) creations to be sufficiently valuable／useful that you want to help finance the ongoing development＆expansion of these educational public service websites, this is the easiest, least onerous, and most efficacious way to do so, with ≥**92**% of anything you [donate there](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BFGriffith) going directly to fund the ongoing creation of similar content in the future, which you’ll hopefully also continue to enjoy＆appreciate! 🔜
> (Moreover, while secure＆easy digital transactions are arguably worth paying a reasonably small “cut” for as a valuable service which most creators wouldn’t want to handle providing on their own, the fact is that most other more popular “crowdfunding” or “creator economy” patronage／support platform websites these days greedily take a higher percentage of all donations and _also_ charge significantly more payment transaction or other fees… 👎🏼)
* 🫙In summary, you can safely consider [this website to be B.F. Griffith’s official **secure virtual “tip jar”**](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BFGriffith) maximally conveniently available for anyone who wishes to contribute, with no signup／pledging hassles or even any account creation required, and any level of even occasional funding that anyone feels they can afford to provide is certainly greatly appreciated! ❤️
> That said, the reality is that audiences increasingly expect／hope for digital content (which of course can be effortlessly copied＆shared) to be _freely_ available, such that the internet can become both midwife＆executioner to “publishing” on an unprecedented scale… Ergo, the economics of purchasing intangible creative or nonfiction works, let alone earning any significant income from producing them, have become complex, contentious, and far beyond the power of any one person to unilaterally change or _control_.
> 
> Regardless, instead of “paywalls” or membership／subscription fees, “crowdfunding” drives to finance specific projects, or spamming too many obnoxious ads or sponsorships everywhere, B.F. Griffith has chosen the simplest mechanism he could find for accepting small donations from supporters in order to navigate these inexorable realities as best he can, considering that the overwhelming majority of what he creates is published _freely_ available to all, which is precisely as he would prefer it. This way, those among his supporters who _do_ happen to have both means＆inclination to help fund his work directly in any capacity will hopefully find [the primary mechanism provided for that](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BFGriffith) to be a useful＆reasonable option (that should ideally be preferable compared to many widely popular “audience patronage” alternatives)…
### Or perhaps you would prefer some more tangible “merch” in exchange for more indirect support?
* If you happen to instead (or additionally) have any interest in purchasing what are hopefully fun／amusing variously “**nerdy**” assorted **physical products** (i.e. 🛍 “**merch**”), many items of which could make delightful _gifts_ for most varieties of nerds in your life who you might happen to be shopping for… then please feel free to check out some of the conveniently available merchandise for sale on demand at:
