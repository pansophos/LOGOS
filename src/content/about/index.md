  items:
  - title: "πάνσοφος"
    description: "The goal of the “Pansophos” project is to organize, compile, index, and juxtapose shorter nonfiction writings by B.F. Griffith into specific areas of interest. As Isaac Asimov once so eloquently put it: “Education isn’t something you can finish.” Ergo, manere humilem et semper studeo. Or, as Quintus Horatius Flaccus (“Horace”) so famously exhorted in his 20 ʙ.ᴄ.ᴇ. “Epistularum Liber Primus” correspondence: “Dimidium facti, qui coepit, habet; sapere aude, incipe.”"

* Logical fallacies or cognitive biases are identifiable flaws or errors in reasoning…
* Whether deliberately or unconsciously, these “tricks” or illusions or mistakes of thought can often be misused by devious sophistry to irrationally mislead people, and tend to be particularly prevalent in the rhetoric of demagogic politicians or unscrupulous media pundits. Don’t be fooled!
* This website seeks to empower you to more accurately recognize＆identify, better avoid in your own thinking, and even capably expose or cogently refute a plethora of specific categories of fallacies or cognitive biases.

#### 🖖🏼 Greetings from the primary ✍🏼 author＆webmaster behind this project! 🧠
B.F. Griffith is just another middle-aged nerdy intellectual with too many hobbies and never enough time for them all; he’s a verbose, sardonic, discerning, skeptical, and sometimes cynical iconoclast－but also a convivial, amiable, voluptuary, and humanistic Epicurean. As a former history teacher and longtime student of philosophy with a keen interest in historiography, he spends much of his free time happily dwelling in the past (or in fantastical worlds of his own imagining), and he is an insatiable bibliophile. 📖♥️
