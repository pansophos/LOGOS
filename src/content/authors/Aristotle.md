🏛 Ancient Greek philosopher＆polymath “Aristotle” wrote about a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and aesthetics. As the founder of the περιπατητικός (“Peripatetic” ≝ “walking about” ⟦the Athenian Λύκειον ≍ “Lyceum”⟧) school of philosophy in Athens, he originated massively influential Aristotelian traditions which set the groundwork for the development of many aspects of scientific methodologies＆taxonomies, plus he also famously acted as tutor for Μέγας Ἀλέξανδρος (“Alexander the Great”), one of the most influential conquerors of the ancient world.
